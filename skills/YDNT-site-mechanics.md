# YDNT Site Mechanics
# youdontneedthis.us — How This Site Actually Works

## THE FOOD TRUCK ANALOGY

Think of the site as a food truck operation:

| Analogy | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| The Menu | `products.csv` (downloaded from Google Sheets) |
| The Kitchen | `youdontneedthis-inventory` repo (photos, videos, thumbnails) |
| The Printer | `build.js` (reads menu + kitchen, prints one HTML file) |
| The Laminated Menu Card | `dist/index.html` (the actual website file, 318KB) |
| The Window | GitHub Pages (shows the card to customers) |
| The Customer | Anyone visiting youdontneedthis.us |

**The Golden Rule:** Every time menu OR kitchen changes, you MUST run the printer and put a new card in the window.

## THE THREE SOURCES OF TRUTH

```
SOURCE 1: Google Sheets
   URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17OHlKS3aTwR0ane3qJefjXm6SPHpI6KqYO0Qg4jFyvk/
   Role: Master product data (names, prices, descriptions, specs, categories)
   Output: products.csv → saved to site repo
   Rule: If item not in Sheet → not on website. Period.

SOURCE 2: youdontneedthis-inventory (GitHub repo)
   Local:  /Users/nicholasdemeter/Documents/youdontneedthis-inventory
   GitHub: https://github.com/NicholasDemeter/youdontneedthis-inventory
   Role: All photos, videos, thumbnails
   Rule: If no matching folder → item shows on site with NO images

SOURCE 3: youdontneedthis-site (GitHub repo)
   Local:  /Users/nicholasdemeter/Documents/youdontneedthis-site
   GitHub: https://github.com/NicholasDemeter/youdontneedthis-site
   Role: Site code + build script + products.csv + generated HTML
   Key files: build.js, products.csv, dist/index.html
```

## HOW IMAGES GET FROM YOUR MAC TO THE WEBSITE

```
YOUR MAC
Local inventory folder
/Users/nicholasdemeter/Documents/youdontneedthis-inventory/LOT_002_.../Photos/LOT_002_01.jpg
   │
   │  [build.js reads this at build time]
   │
   ▼
build.js constructs a GitHub URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicholasDemeter/youdontneedthis-inventory/main/LOT_002_.../Photos/LOT_002_01.jpg
   │
   │  [this URL is baked into dist/index.html]
   │
   ▼
Browser on youdontneedthis.us loads that URL directly from GitHub
   │
   ▼
Image appears on site
```

---

## FOLDER MATCHING — HOW build.js FINDS YOUR PHOTOS

```
products.csv row:
LOT = "LOT_002"
FOLDER_NAME = "LOT_002_Microsoft_Surface_Studio_2_All_in_One_Desktop"

build.js matching logic (in order):
   1. Try exact FOLDER_NAME match against local inventory
      → "LOT_002_Microsoft_Surface_Studio_2_All_in_One_Desktop" exists? ✅ USE IT
   
   2. If no exact match, try PREFIX match:
      → Find any folder starting with "LOT_002_" ✅ USE IT
   
   3. If neither match:
      → Show placeholder image (grey "No Image Available" box)

CRITICAL RULES:
✅ Folder MUST have something after LOT_### → "LOT_002_anything" works
❌ "LOT_002" alone (no underscore after) → may not match
✅ Case insensitive matching
✅ Accepted photo formats: .jpg .jpeg .png .gif .webp
```

## MOBILE-CRITICAL PATTERNS (DO NOT BREAK)

### iOS Safari Video Playback
**REQUIRED:** The hero `<video>` tag MUST have `playsinline` attribute.
```html
<video class="hero-video" autoplay muted loop playsinline>
```
Without `playsinline`, video fails **silently** on iOS Safari (no error, no playback).
Location in build.js: Line ~1253

### Viewport Units
**USE:** `100svh` (small viewport height) instead of `100vh` for mobile.
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero { min-height: 100svh; }  /* NOT 100vh */
}
```
Reason: Accounts for iOS Safari's collapsing address bar. Prevents layout shift on scroll.

### Mobile Breakpoints
```
Desktop:  > 768px  (no overrides)
Tablet:   ≤ 768px  (@media (max-width: 768px))
Phone:    ≤ 480px  (@media (max-width: 480px))
```
All mobile CSS lives in these TWO media query blocks at the end of the `<style>` tag.
**NEVER** scatter mobile rules outside these blocks.

### Button Width Pattern
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .special-btn {
    width: 100%;          /* Fills container */
    max-width: 280px;     /* BUT capped for thumb reach */
    margin: 0 auto;       /* Centered, not edge-to-edge */
  }
}
```
Full-width buttons (no max-width) break mobile UX. User's thumb can't reach center.

### Product Grid Responsive Pattern
```css
/* Tablet: 2-column auto-fit */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .lots-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(160px, 1fr)); }
}

/* Phone: Single column (readability) */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .lots-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
  .lot-thumbnail { height: 200px; }  /* Taller for single column */
}
```

---

## CSS MODIFICATION RULES

**CRITICAL:** All CSS lives inside `build.js` as a template literal, NOT in `dist/index.html`.

```
CORRECT WORKFLOW:
1. Edit CSS inside build.js (around line 394-1242, inside the <style> tag)
2. Run: node build.js
3. Verify: open dist/index.html in browser
4. Commit both build.js AND dist/index.html
5. Push

NEVER:
- Edit CSS in dist/index.html directly (it's regenerated on every build)
- Add external .css files (entire site is single-file HTML)
```

**Mobile CSS Location:**
- Desktop styles: Lines ~394-1214 (main CSS block)
- Mobile overrides: Single `@media (max-width: 768px)` block at line ~1215
- Small phone overrides: `@media (max-width: 480px)` block (if present)

**The Rule:** Mobile CSS changes ONLY go in the @media blocks. Never scatter !important 
or mobile-specific rules in the main CSS block.

## KNOWN ISSUES AS OF JUNE 26, 2026

### ISSUE #1 — Inventory branch naming (LOW PRIORITY)
Local inventory branch is `master`, GitHub is `main`.
Push command: `git push origin master:main`
Functional but inconsistent. Rename when convenient.

# Expected: 2-5 (only LOT_023 and LOT_064)
# If 100+: images broken

# Test specific image URL
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicholasDemeter/youdontneedthis-inventory/main/LOT_002_Microsoft_Surface_Studio_2_All_in_One_Desktop/LOT_002_THUMBNAIL.jpg"
# Expected: 200

# What commit is on GitHub?
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/NicholasDemeter/youdontheedthis-site/commits/main | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['sha'][:7], d['commit']['message'])"

# Cache status
curl -s -I https://youdontneedthis.us | grep -i "age\|last-modified"

## ROOT CAUSE FOUND — June 22, 2026 (UPDATE)

### Why Images Were Never Loading — The Definitive Answer

**The CI/CD Problem (now understood and fixed):**

```
WHAT HAPPENED:
1. deploy.yml was created with a "node build.js" step
2. GitHub Actions checked out ONLY the site repo on its servers
3. ../youdontneedthis-inventory (sibling folder) does NOT exist on GitHub's servers
4. build.js ran in CI, found no inventory, generated 207 placeholders
5. That broken build was deployed — NOT our locally-built dist/index.html

THE FIX:
- Removed "node build.js" step from deploy.yml
- CI now deploys whatever dist/index.html is already committed
- build.js MUST always run locally (where inventory exists) before every push
- This is not a bug — it is the correct architecture going forward

CONFIRMED BY:
- Claude Code diagnostic June 22, 2026
- cache-busted curl showed 1 placeholder, 0 raw GitHub URLs, 0 PREMIUM ITEMS
- Previous deployments confirmed: April 22 was last good deploy before today
- All commits between April 22 and June 22 were never deployed (no deploy.yml existed)
```

**The Non-Negotiable Rule This Creates:**

```
BEFORE EVERY PUSH:
1. node build.js (locally, where inventory exists)
2. grep -c "No Image Available" dist/index.html → must be LOW (2-5 max)
3. ONLY THEN: git push origin main

NEVER:
- Push without rebuilding locally first
- Let GitHub Actions run build.js (it has no inventory access)
- Trust that a push = correct images on live site without verification
```

**Why This Was So Hard To Find:**
- deploy.yml didn't exist for 2 months → no deployments happened
- When we added deploy.yml WITH build step → first deploy used CI rebuild → placeholders
- Images at correct URLs (200 response) but wrong build was live
- Browser cache served April 22 build intermittently confusing diagnosis
